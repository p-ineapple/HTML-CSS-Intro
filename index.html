        Soleil is the daughter of Laslow. She can also be the sister of the Male Kana or Shigure if Laslow achieves a S-Support with the Female Corrin or Azura. Like the other children of Fates, she was placed in the Deeprealms to protect her from the war. While she stayed in her Deeprealm for most of the time, she eventually became interested in mercenary work and amassed a large crew who help out those in need. It is said that her group is always smiling due to her philosophies of keeping a positive attitude.
        </p>
        <p>
            In her Paralogue, Soleil and her group of mercenaries arrive in the normal world and are helping to fend off bandits from a local town. However, after fending off the latest bandit attack, the bandits return with a large force out to exact revenge. As luck would have it, Laslow is nearby after receiving reports of the bandit attacks. Silas informs him that the bandits are attacking the town and overhears that Soleil is among the town watch repelling the bandits. Without a moment to spare, Laslow charges into battle without a second thought and eventually reaches her. Soleil tries her best to keep a positive attitude in front of her father, but ultimately her facade crumbles as she admits that she was scared. Laslow calms her down, telling her it is okay not to smile. However, he recommends that she laugh if she cannot smile, as it can throw off her opponents. After routing the bandits, Soleil has a heart-to-heart with her father. Silas notes that her pep could help with morale in the otherwise grim army. Thrilled by the idea of being with her father, Soleil begs him to take her. After much consideration, Laslow agrees. Suddenly, a village maiden comes to Soleil to thank her for fending off the bandits by giving her a gift. However, Soleil pauses, enamored by the village maiden and invites her to go stargazing together, which she accepts. Laslow is amazed by his daughter's smoothness and hopes to learn a few new tricks.

                    Claude is the heir to House Riegan, the preeminent house of the Leicester Alliance, and the grandson of its leader through his mother, Tiana. Though he was born in Imperial Year 1162, he was not legitimated as heir until Imperial Year 1179, a year before enrolling at the Officers Academy.
                    In his academic years, he is the house leader of Golden Deer. Claude is described as easygoing at the surface, but has a side that forces others to keep their guard around him. His introduction to Byleth at the Officers Academy emphasizes this as he refrains from divulging his potential professor any information about himself to give himself a "sense of mystery" and to entice them to choose his house in order to get to know him better. While appearing lazy and casual, he is far more astute than he lets on and is always a few steps ahead of his peers during conversations.
